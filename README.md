# IOT-DRIVEN-SYSTEM-FOR-SUSTAINABLE-FISH-FARMING-

This project focuses on addressing the challenges hindering the fish farming industry in Nigeria through the implementation of IoT solution. Nigeria's fish farming sector plays a crucial role in ensuring food security and economic development. However, it faces an obstacle, which is the limited use of technology in fish farming. To overcome this challenge, this research proposes a solution that integrates IoT technology into fish farming operations. The proposed system will employ a Microcontroller unit, sensors and actuators to monitor and manage key parameters such as PH level of the water, temperature and turbidity. Furthermore, the project will involve the development of a user-friendly web application that allows farmers to remotely monitor their fish farming operations. Keywords: IoT, automation, sustainable fish farming, sensors, actuators, water quality monitoring, turbidity, data analytics, web application, logging.
